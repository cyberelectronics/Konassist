Before you use this software consider the following: 
you are interfering with your car and doing that with hardware and software beyond your control.
Any car is a possibly lethal piece of machinery and you might hurt or kill yourself or others using it, 
or even paying attention to the displays instead of watching the road. 
Be extremely prudent!
